This is a patch version of putty, which support obfuscation!

More about obfuscation please refer:

And it's based on Mr.Hinky Drink's Potty.

I just apply his patch and modify it to work with *nix.

For building on Unix:

 - cd to unix/
 - run `make -f Makefile.ux`

For building on Linux:

 - cd to unix.
 - run `make -f Makefile.linux`

There're some differences between standard unix and linux.
